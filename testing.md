## Contrast

Using the chrome extension: Wave, it came to my attention that the contrast was off for the text in the navigation bar and the footer

1. Checked contrast on Wave and it was showing 7 errors.

1. I used the contrast checker on webaim.org and found that my chosen colours failed mostly everything.

1. I used the sliding scale to adjust the background colour lightness until I saw a pass on all tests and decided to use the salmon pink colour (#de7891) that was suggested.

1. I checked the wave extension again after I used the new background colour for the navigation bar and footer and no contrast errors came up so I decided to keep the newe colour as it matched the website colour scheme really well and would not cause any issues for sight impared users.
